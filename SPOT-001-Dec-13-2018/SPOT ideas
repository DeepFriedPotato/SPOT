Welcome to Day 1 of SPOT!

Today's goal is to brainstorm ideas for future projects and to work with Git a bit more.

What can I do?

- A personal website? I'm inclined to write a 20th century website with no dependencies. Hosted on a server I control of course.
- Train my own neural network using the good'o MNIST database of handwritten digits.
- Get back to speed with Python. I need some ideas for mini projects
- C! Get ready for Algorithms and Data Structures by practicing linked lists and sorting and stuff
- Hey! Writing quick sort in as many languages as possible?
- I want a stable Linux system I can SSH into. Not the university one.
- Write an Apple Watch app.
- Try Metal graphics library.
- Learn JavaScript (where do I start)
- Unity? Basic shooter game?

- https://glitch.com
- Try some more Apple frameworks
    - ARKit
